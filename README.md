# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on a kickstarter data set to uncover trends


Findings report that Louis should focus on her kickstarter campaign in the summer months. The data shows that the months of May and June are optimal times for creating a kickstarter and will likely generate a higher number of pledges than other times of the year. It also seems that the budget for her kickstart campaign for her play should be roughly between $3,500 to $4,000. Plays are more common and seem to have a higher success rate than musicals and spaces in both the United States and Great Britain. See attached images for reference.
